slide latch
Just getting started in the 3D Printer world and will attempt to design a snap-in slide latch that is easily scalable for any size opening in a metal door.  I have two broken plastic latches of different sizes that have turned brittle and disintegrated in the AZ sun.  One is for a BBQ door and the other is for gardening equipment.  I'll add more as I start to figure out FreeCAD.
